The list page should show a sorted view of all the cards in the list with options to sort and filter that view. There should be a header at the top that has the name of the list and maybe a short description or image to identify the list. There should be a side panel or menu that lets you navigate to other list-related pages such as version control, analyis, and notes. There should be options somewhere to import cards and export the list in various forms.

Different view options:
- table view (cube view)
- decklist view
- details list view (bulk edit from cubecobra, essentially shows every card in a single list with columns for name, metadata, tags, etc)
- visual spoiler

General design layout:
- hero/header with list name and image/description
- main content is the card list
- card preview on hover, show card details on click, have some method for selecting or right clicking cards to do actions without opening card details
- small header over the card list with a search bar for filtering and options to change the view or the sort
- edits are just made to the list, have an option to show unsaved/uncommited changes with a visual indicator like highlighting the card or showing a red/grayed out card for deleted cards. leave more complex stuff for the version control page/panel
